You need to present at least  two project proposals from each group on 17.02.23 which will contain around 7.5% marks of the total course. Your project proposal should contain the following information

 

1. Brief about the project ( in bullet points ), what is the expected outcome

2. Methodology

3. A diagram explaining the project

4. Technology stack

5. Gantt chart explaining the timeline

6. Work distribution.

 

I have also attached a sample project proposal for your convenience. Duration for the each group is 10 minutes with question and answer.
